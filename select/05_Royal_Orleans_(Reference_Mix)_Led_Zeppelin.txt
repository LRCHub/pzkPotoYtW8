One time love, take care how you use it
Try to make it last all night, and if you take your pick
Be careful how you choose it, sometimes its hard to feel it bite

Feel it bite

A man I know, went down to Louisiana
Had himself a bad, bad fight
And when the sun peeked through
John cameron with Suzanna
He kissed the whiskers, left anf right

Whiskers

Now, now, now, fright subsides
Out at a hotel in the quarter, our friends check in to pass the night
Now love gets hot, but fire preceded water
Poor whiskers set the room alight

Whiskers

Down on Bourbon street, you know it's right
You can see my friend, they run around all through the night
Most everywhere, until the closet's bare
Run for the razor, doin' up my hair

New orleans queens, sure know how to schmooze it
Maybe for some that seems alright
When i step out, strut down with my sugar
She'd best not talk like barry white
One time love, take care how you use it
Try to make it last all night, and if you take your pick
Be careful how you choose it, sometimes its hard to feel it bite

Feel it bite
