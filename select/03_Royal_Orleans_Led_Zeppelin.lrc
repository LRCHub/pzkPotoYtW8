[00:09.01] One-time love,
[00:11.15] Take care how you use it
[00:13.48] Try to make it last all night
[00:17.73] And if you take your pick,
[00:19.76] Be careful how you choose it
[00:22.25] Sometimes it's hard to feel it bite
[00:39.75] 
[00:30.69] Feel it bite
[00:36.69] 
[00:35.72] A man I know
[00:37.86] Went down to Louisiana,
[00:40.67] Had himself a bad, bad fight
[00:44.25] And when the sun peeked through
[00:46.46] John Cameron with Suzanna,
[00:49.00] He kissed the whiskers, left and right
[01:08.00] 
[00:57.17] Whiskers!
[01:01.67] 
[01:10.33] Now, now, now, fright subsides
[01:12.90] Out at a hotel in the quarter,
[01:15.27] Our friends check in to pass the night
[01:19.45] Now love gets hot,
[01:21.83] But fire preceded water
[01:23.90] Poor whiskers set the room alight.
[01:40.90] 
[01:49.15] Whiskers!
[01:53.65] 
[01:54.11] Down on Bourbon Street,
[01:57.97] You know, it's right
[01:59.71] You can see, my friend,
[02:01.46] They run around all through the night
[02:03.68] Most everywhere
[02:05.59] Until the closet's bare
[02:07.67] Run for the razor fun
[02:10.00] Doin' up my hair
[02:18.00] 
[02:13.23] New Orleans queens
[02:15.51] Sure know how to schmooze it
[02:18.12] Maybe for some that seems alright
[02:21.98] When I step out,
[02:24.20] Strut down with my sugar
[02:26.25] She'd best not talk like Barry White!
[02:44.75] 
[02:31.25] Now one town love,
[02:33.05] Take care how you use it
[02:35.25] Try to make it last all night
[02:39.69] Take your pick
[02:41.52] Be careful how you choose it
[02:43.92] Sometimes it's hard to feel it bite, ah
